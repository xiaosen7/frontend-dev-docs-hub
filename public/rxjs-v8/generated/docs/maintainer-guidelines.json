They are words to live by for those that are tasked with reviewing and merging pull requests and otherwise\nshepherding the community. As the roster of trusted maintainers grows, we'll expect these guidelines to stay pretty\nmuch the same (but suggestions are always welcome).</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-10-6-commandments\">The <del>10</del> 6 Commandments<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"maintainer-guidelines#the-10-6-commandments\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"../../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">Code of Conduct</a></strong>. We should be setting a good example and be welcoming to all. We should be listening\nto all feedback from everyone in our community and respect their viewpoints and opinions.</li>\n<li><strong>Be sure PRs meet <a href=\"../../../CONTRIBUTING.md\">Contribution Guidelines</a></strong>. It's important we keep our code base\nand repository consistent. The best way to do this is to know and enforce the contribution guidelines.</li>\n<li><strong>Clean, flat commit history</strong>. We never click the green merge button on PRs, but instead we pull down\nthe PR branch and rebase it against master then replace master with the PR branch. See\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/jeffbcross/307c6da45d26e29030ef\">example gist</a>. This reduces noise in the commit\nhistory, removing all of the merge commits, and keeps history flat. The flat history is beneficial\nto tools/scripts that analyze commit ancestry.</li>\n<li><strong>Always green master</strong>. Failing master builds tend to cascade into other broken builds, and\nfrustration among other contributors who have rebased against a broken master. Much of our deployment\nand other infrastructure is based on the assumption that master is always green, nothing should be\nmerged before Travis has confirmed that a PR is green, even for seemingly insignificant changes.\nNothing should be merged into a red master, and whomever broke it should drop everything and fix it\nright away. Fixes should be submitted as a PR and verified as green instead of immediately merging\nto master.</li>\n<li><strong>No force pushes to master</strong>. Only in rare circumstances should a force push to master be made,\nand other maintainers should be notified beforehand. The most common situation for a justified force\npush is when a commit has been pushed with an invalid message. The force push should be made as soon\nas possible to reduce side effects.</li>\n<li><strong>Small, logical commits</strong>. A PR should be focused on a single problem, though that problem may be\nreasonable to be broken into a few logical commits. For example, a global renaming may be best to be\nbroken into a single commit that renames all files, and then a commit that renames symbols within files.\nThis makes the review process simpler easier, so the diff of the meaty commit (where symbols are\nrenamed) can be easily understood than if both were done in the same commit, in which case github would\njust show a deleted file and an added file.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n<!-- links to this doc:\n-->\n<!-- links from this doc:\n - ../../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n - ../../../CONTRIBUTING.md\n - maintainer-guidelines#maintainer-guidelines\n - maintainer-guidelines#the-10-6-commandments\n - https://gist.github.com/jeffbcross/307c6da45d26e29030ef\n - https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS/issues/121#issue-97747542\n-->"
